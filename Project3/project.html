                    Each player starts with 12 pieces off of the board. Three large pieces, three medium pieces, three small pieces, and three tiny pieces.
                    These pieces are arranged in three stacks like russian nesting dolls, which prevents the player from moving a medium piece before a large piece,
                    and so on. The players take turns either moving one of their pieces in their off board stack onto the board, or a piece already on the board.
                    The goal of the game is to connect four pieces in a row either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Lastly, this game wouldn't be complete
                    without the ability to gobble your opponents pieces. In other words, the player may place one of their larger pieces ontop of any smaller piece. Use this
                    to advance your stategy.

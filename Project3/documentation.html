                        Prototype Process:
                    </h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Carefully chose the dimensions on the PIXI screen to be 1200px wide by 900px tall.</li>
                        <li> Created the art assets, and set up the grid-like board.</li>
                        <li> Set up the class architecture. The board is composed of Stacks, Stacks are composed of Pieces.</li>
                        <li> Loaded 24 pieces into 6 different stacks off of the board.</li>
                        <li> Enabled dragging functionality, and made pieces snap into place.</li>
                        <li> Made game loop. Player moves, then the opponent moves. So on and so forth until there is a winner.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>
                        Final Process:
                    </h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Began implementation of Alpha-Beta pruning with the minimax algorithm.</li>
                        <li> Generated game tree with a depth of 3, and calculated (numerically) the best move for the opponent.</li>
                        <li> Had issues with propegating information about the best move back up the tree, so decided to break from
                            this method of AI, and focused on an alternative, with every intention to revist it in the near future.</li>
                        <li> Started building a different AI that calculates moves based on a few rules. Move to a winning position if possible,
                             Block the opponent from winning, and prioritize claiming center positions over outer positions.</li>

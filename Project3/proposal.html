                        This is a strategy game that combines LaBlancâ€™s Taxonomy of Challenge and Sensation that makes for an interesting twist on an already classic : Connect Four.

                        There is no story to the game per-se; however the motive of the player is to place four of their pieces in a row on the board to get the satisfaction of
                        beating their opponent.

                        This game is photo-realistic interpretation of what the board game counter-part looks like. The sound will be quite simplistic and will include no background
                        music. Tracks included will be for victory/loss music and simple sound effects for moving a piece on the board or gobbling another players piece up.

                        This game is best described as a Connect Four meets Hungry Hungry Hippos. Each player starts with 12 pieces of their color (tan or black) : three large.
                        three medium large, three medium small, and three small. These pieces are initially arranged off the board in three stacks (like russian nesting dolls).
                        This prevents users from using a small piece before using the three larger pieces stacked on top of it. When a piece is moved from off the board, it can
                        only be moved to an empty space, or to gobble an opponent to prevent an immediate win (ie. three in a row). These restrictions do not apply to pieces that
                        are already on the board. Infact, a player may gobble their own piece if they so choose to. To control the game, the users (2) will take turns using the mouse
                        to move one of their pieces. If the user attempts to move their piece to an invalid position (onto a piece larger than or equal to in size), the the piece will
                        simply snap back into its original position. Each player will have 30 seconds to complete thier turn; failire to do so will result in them surrendering their turn.
